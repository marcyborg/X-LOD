X-LOD
===================

A Content Management System to edit and publish your Linked Open Data. X-LOD has been inspired by the Wikidata project with RDF data and triplestores in mind.

X-LOD is currently in pre-beta version. If you want to see how it works, register an account at http://sisinf03.poliba.it and play with the data already loaded or load new ones. Currently, you find there data coming from the LOD dataset of Matera (take a look at http://dati.comune.matera.it/lod/).
